'''
Given the root node of a binary tree and two distinct values, find the lowest common ancestor.

Input: Root Node, Two Integer Values
Output: Integer Value of Lowest Common Ancestor

                            5
                    2                   7
                                    4       8
                                                9
Input: root, 4, 9 => Output: 7 LowestCommonAncestor

Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(N)
Integer values of nodes are all distinct.

Binary Tree Node has the following properties:

value (Integer)
right (Binary Tree Node, default null)
left (Binary Tree Node, default null)

The lowest common ancestor is the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendants, where n1 and n2
are the nodes for which we wish to find the LCA. Hence, the LCA of a binary tree with nodes n1 and n2 is the shared
ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.

    The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with the root,
     then the root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If the root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, 
     we recur for the left and right subtree. 

    The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in the right subtree is the LCA. 
    If both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA also, 
    Otherwise, LCA lies in the right subtree.
