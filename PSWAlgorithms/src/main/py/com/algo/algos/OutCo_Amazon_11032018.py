- Given a string of characters representing a series of integer additions (e.g. "-1+2+3", return the sum.
Also, make it modular to support future operations.

- Write a function to approximate a square root, without using the built-in square root function.
It should be accurate within a specific threshold (e.g. plus or minus 0.001).

- Given a diagram of a system designed to retrieve information from a generic list API,
how would you optimize this process? (A rather open-ended question with some very Amazon-specific details
I'm not gonna get into.)
