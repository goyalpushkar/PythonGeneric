'''
Given a number n, find all the Strobogrammatic numbers of length n.

A Strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees.

Example One
{
"n": "2"
}
Output:

["11", "69", "88", "96"]
Example Two
{
"n": "1"
}
Output:

["0", "1", "8"]
Notes
Rotation by 180 degrees is equivalent to looking at the number upside down.

You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 12
