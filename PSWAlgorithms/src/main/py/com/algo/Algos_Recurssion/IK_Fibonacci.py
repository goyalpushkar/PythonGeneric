'''
Given a number n, find the n-th Fibonacci Number.

Example
{
"n": 2
}
Output:
1
2nd Fibonacci Number is the sum of the 0th and 1st Fibonacci Number = 0 + 1 = 1.

Notes
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 and F(n) = F(n âˆ’ 1) + F(n âˆ’ 2) for n > 1.

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 46
