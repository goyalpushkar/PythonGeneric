'''
Given a pointer to an arbitrary node in a sorted circular linked list, find the median value of the elements.

Example One
Example one

Given pointer points to the node with value 4.

Output:

6
The sequence is sorted by value so the median value is the middle node. The answer does not depend on the specific node given as input: as long as the list is as pictured, the answer is 6.

Example Two
Example Two

Given pointer points to the node with value 4.

Output:

5
If the number of nodes is even, the median is the average of two middle values. This list is sorted in the descending order.

Notes
If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements in the sorted sequence.
Constraints:

1 <= number of elements in the list <= 105
-2 * 109 <= value in the list <= 2 * 109
All numbers in the input list are even
