This article discusses the quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential building using statistical machine learning tools.
It studied the impact of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) using robust classical regression and state of the art nonlinear and non-parametric statistical machine learning tools (random forests).
This article answers the following questions:
	• It clarifies on how to develop a statistical qualitative machine learning model for a problem. It explains the steps required like data analysis using the statistical methods, develop a model based on linearity of the variables, and finally testing of the model using cross validation techniques.
	• It explains on how normalization helps to handle different  range of values for different variables, how plotting probability distribution or histograms can explain the statistical properties of the variables.
	• It explains on different methods to check the association of different variables like spearman rank correlation coefficient to check association strength, p values to check statistical significance of relationships, mutual information to quantify any arbitrary relationships.
	• Due to continuous range of output variables regression model makes more sense. It explains MAE, MSE, MRE are helpful for cross validation of the model.
	• It shows how the most important variable from logical and practical purposes may not even be correlated to the output. E.g. glazing area in the provided paper. It explains why correlation shouldn’t be assumed for causality.
	• It explains how a generic statistical machine learning model can be effective as compared to simulation model as the same ML model can be used to add or remove additional input or output variables while lot of changes or rework may be required in case of simulation models.
