Hi Amarprit,

You are right that the article mentioned other approaches like qualitative and quantitative being used in the past but they picked linear regression only to relax certain assumptions and to simplify the model after combining it with bivariate statistical analyses (BSA).
Decision trees or random forests may give better result but they will add a lot of complexity in the model.
